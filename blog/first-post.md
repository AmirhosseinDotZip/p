# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! This is an example post to demonstrate how the blog system works.

## How it works

Posts are written in Markdown format and stored in the blog directory. The blog page automatically loads and displays them in a grid layout.

You can write **bold text**, *italic text*, and even add code blocks:

```javascript
console.log("Hello from my blog!");
```
